# Meeting


---
#### Agenda 

Quick Summary: Excellent
- Good job with the agenda! It was uploaded on time, it is easy to follow and contains most relevant info. Keep up the good work!

#### Performance of the *Previous* Minute Taker

Quick Summary: Good 

Feedback: Notes look comprehensive! The layout could be a bit better, though. Think about incorporating bullet points and enumerations wherever you can, so that information is easier to digest quickly.

#### Chair performance

Quick Summary: Sufficient
- You tried to keep the meeting focused on the agenda points, which is good. 
- The meeting ran a bit too chaotically. This has more to do with the team's tendency to go too deep into the technical details, and not necessarily because of how you structured the meeting.
	+ The main learning point is for you to be more comfortable with interrupting people if necessary. If you see that someone is jumping to another agenda point, you can always tell them to hold their idea and talk after. 
	+ You're not rude for doing this! You're just keeping some structure. Here's an example:
		+ If someone starts talking about the features they just started working on when presenting their product, you can just say: "That's a good point, please hold your idea and we can talk about it during the planning part of the meeting."
		+ In case of someone bringing up something new that is **not** part of the agenda, you can pause the meeting very briefly, ask the note-taker to write the point down (or write it down yourself), and then dedicate time at the end of the meeting to the discussion point.

#### Attitude & Relation


Quick Summary: Sufficient

Feedback: 
- Atmosphere is good overall!
- For every discussion point, just a gentle reminder (for future chairs) to ask if anybody has any other thing to add. You've done this as chair this week, so that's perfect.
- I do not think everyone gets to share their thoughts equally, which may lead to a project that encompasses less diverse ideas and solutions. To work on this, I have two action points:

	- The people who normally do not speak up should try speaking more. Think about, for instance, one idea per agenda point.
	- The people who tend to speak up should **actively ask for other people's feedback** when they share an idea. Think of sentences such as 'what do you think about this?', 'would you solve this in another way?', 'are there people who disagree with what I am saying?'.

#### Potentially Shippable Product


Quick Summary: Sufficient
- At the end of ***every sprint***, have your features merged to main and integrated together. When you see me, you should be able to see me the state of your main branch by just running the app.

- The demo should be presentable from **one** laptop, it should not be that we go through every person individually. That takes up a lot of the meeting's time.
- Keep demos separate from discussions. The demo should be about what you have so far, and nothing else. If you need to discuss additional points, dedicate extra agenda points to that.

#### Work Contribution/Distribution in the Team

Quick Summary: Sufficient

Feedback: 
- Looked good overall. The reason I gave 'sufficient' only was the duplicate work issue that you mentioned, but I understand that this is a one-time thing :)
