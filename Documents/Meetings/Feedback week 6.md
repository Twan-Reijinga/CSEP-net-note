# Meeting



#### Agenda 

Quick Summary: Good 

Feedback: 
- I think the timing has consistently not been realistic. I think it's usually fine, but it's the demo that takes longer than you'd expect it to, try adding some more time next time :)


#### Performance of the *Previous* Minute Taker

Quick Summary: Excellent

Feedback: I'm happy with the notes! I think this structure is easy to read and the notes are comprehensive enough.



#### Chair performance

Quick Summary: Good

- Good for interrupting the demo for technical difficulties!



#### Attitude & Relation


Quick Summary: Good!

Feedback: 
- Nice job on taking initiative to ask Twan and Petar for their input explicitly, @Oleh!
- I would encourage everyone to do that!



#### Potentially Shippable Product


Quick Summary: Good
- Good demo overall! Just make sure that you have everything ready to go from the start to save time, though I imagine it was more difficult in a hybrid format.



#### Work Contribution/Distribution in the Team

Quick Summary: Sufficient

Feedback: 
- Things look good to me overall. This rubric has mainly been bumped down by the knockout criteria not being met by Tushit. I'd say keep up the good work!
