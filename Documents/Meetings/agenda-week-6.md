## Discussion Topics

### 1. Clarify updating our issues on Friday? (5min)

- On monday we didn't reach an agreement on what to do with updating the issues on friday.
    -  Either update the issues through time tracking in gitlab
    -  Or update the issues in the description of them

### 2. Distributing the extra features in the future (10min)

- During the monday meeting we hadn't agreed over a sufficient plan for our task distribution.
- For this sprint we established a distribution, however we felt that during the christmass break this won't hold. Since Tushit will be done soon with the language switch.
- We discussed the possibility of multiple people working on a single feature...
