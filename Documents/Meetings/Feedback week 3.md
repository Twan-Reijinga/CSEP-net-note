# Meeting

#### Agenda 

Quick Summary: Good

Feedback:
- The agenda was uploaded in time. 
- The template was followed, so that's great! The template is not the best though, so you might want to improve a bit on it. 
	+ For instance, you could format each agenda point as a small header, so that different points are easier to follow.
	+ For every agenda point,you can then add some extra bullet points to ensure that you go through all relevant information about that topic. An example below.
	+ The points were clear.


#### Performance of the *Previous* Minute Taker

Quick Summary: Insufficient

Feedback: 
- Not applicable.
- I happened to have already seen the notes of this week, though. I liked them, more concrete feedback next meeting.


#### Chair performance

*TA Instructions:*
Please consider the following dimensions in your assessment:

- Did the chair ensure that all topics of the agenda were covered?
- Were all topics covered for an appropriate amount of time?

Quick Summary: Sufficient

Feedback: 
- You as chair make sure that all points were covered, which is great.
- The topics were reasonably balanced. 
- I would recommend ensuring that everyone stays on track, and that the note taker manages to write every conclusion down. 
	+ To do this, you can literally just stop people or tell them to slow down. So that the note-taker can finish writing.
	+ Moreover, it is useful to explicitly mention the conclusions of an agenda point, confirming that the note-taker got to write them down.


#### Attitude & Relation


Quick Summary: Sufficient

Feedback: 

- You as a team took ownership of the meeting, which is great.
- I did not feel like everyone was involved equally in the discussion, so I'd improve on that.
	+ A concrete point to improve is making sure that everyone agrees with the conclusions of every agenda point.
	+ Give people time to agree/disagree. You can do by explicitly asking 'does everyone agree with this' or 'does anybody disagree' or 'does anybody have anything to add about this'? It is good practice to do this for *every* agenda item.


#### Potentially Shippable Product


Quick Summary: Insufficient

Feedback: 

- Does not really matter at this point in time. Project just begun. For next week, make sure to have something :) 


#### Work Contribution/Distribution in the Team

Quick Summary: Insufficient

Feedback: 

- Also not too relevant for this week. 
- For next time, just ensure that issues are evenly distributed with regards to expected time.


--- 
This is an example of some better structure based on what you have as a template. I've combined it a bit with how I'd style agendas when I was chairing at my associations, if you have any questions feel free to let me know. The **main** take-away is that you would like your agenda to be more structured, so that you make sure you do not forget any relevant points you wanted to discuss.

## Formatting example:

### Opening
1. Check-in: how is everyone doing?
2. Briefly explain all agenda points
3. Add or modify agenda points in case of disagreements
4. If everyone agrees, open the meeting.

### 2. Let the TA know about the meeting this Monday
- Main meeting take-aways

### 3. Git issues
- Discuss the issues format
- Are our issues too broad?
- TODO-s resulting from this point
