# Meeting


#### Agenda 

Quick Summary: Good 

Feedback: 
- Time was more realistic this time around!
- The agenda was also nicely structured!


#### Performance of the *Previous* Minute Taker

Quick Summary: Excellent

Feedback: I'm happy with the notes! I think this structure is easy to read and the notes are comprehensive enough.



#### Chair performance

Quick Summary: Sufficient

- Could have handled the demo situation a little bit better by intervening earlier and stopping it
- Please encourage everyone to give their input if you see that some people are less active
- You kept the structure to a good extent, which is nice




#### Attitude & Relation


Quick Summary: Sufficient

Feedback: 
- Please stick to the functionality implemented during the demo (Liviu)
- A bunch of interrupting to ask questions was going on. If you have something to ask, mention it so that everyone can discuss it later, but don't go into other discussions. People might lose the idea that they wanted to share.
- I think you handled disagreements well when it came to your approach today, that was definitely nice to see! Both Liviu & Oleh listened to each other, which was nice



#### Potentially Shippable Product


Quick Summary: Sufficient

- The demo that you could show was nice and functional, which is why I gave you a passing mark hee.
- However, I could tell that not the entire demo was ready, make sure to have everything on **main** by the time we meet. You should be able to show everything on just one person's computer.
	+ To avoid situations like today, it might be best to set an internal rule where you only showcase features that you implemented by a given day of the week (say, Sunday; can be any day your team reasonably agreed on)
- Please stick to the functionality implemented during the demo (Liviu).


#### Work Contribution/Distribution in the Team

Quick Summary: Sufficient

Feedback: 
- I think you're doing well on this end, as far as splitting tasks goes!
- As far as *done* tasks goes, it did not go great this time; it was difficult for me to tell who did what. It could also be because of the hybrid format of the meeting.
