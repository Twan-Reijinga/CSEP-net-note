    - Pepijn
    - Petar
    - Tushit
    - Twan
 - New agreements:
    - Everyone creates their own issues after they are assigned a task on Monday. This makes sure you understand your task for the week.
    - We should have one controller per directory (api/notes, api/collections, etc.). This cleans the code up.
    - With merge requests you should assign one reviewer, this way it is clear who has to review the MR, and everyone will have to approve an MR each week. Besides it will speed up the approval process, since it is clear who is to approve what.
    - We should create branches out of the issues we made at the start of the sprint, this can be done inside the issue, at the dropdown menu near create an MR. By creating the branches this way, it will automatically link the issues to the MRs.
    - On Friday we will have a check-in, quite similar to a daily standup. However, we'll communicate this via text, since our schedule is full on Friday. The standup should be a short summary: the work you have done this week, what you plan to still do this sprint, and any problems or dependencies on other people.
 - Planning for this week:  
 Our goal this spring is to finish the basic requirements of the note-taking application. To accomplish this, we have to combine our code from the previous sprint and implement some additional features.
