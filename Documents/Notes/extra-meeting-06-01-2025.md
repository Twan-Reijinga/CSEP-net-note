# Meeting Monday 06 January

Present: 
Oleh, Twan, Petar(online)

### Discussed during the meeting:

Discussion about the expected behavior for filtering by tags when multiple collections from multiple servers are loaded in the sidebar:
    - should the tags filter only one collection or all of them?
The conclusion for now is to implement filtering for the collections on the local server and just keep in mind that later it will have to be adapted to work with multiple servers.

Discussion about the behavior of filtering when a search was performed:
    - should the filters be applied to the search result or to all notes in the specified collection? (Awaiting response from the TA on that matter)

Mentioned in the meeting was the fact that the id of Note will be changed from Long to UUID. 

Also discussed, was the possibility of giving Liviu some other tasks, and maybe abandoning the automated change synchronization epic for now, if he is really struggling with it.

Petar should fix his issues with the tags and get a working demo for Wednesday to demonstrate his work during the Christmas break.

### Tasks for next sprint:

Oleh: Plans to finish filtering by collection and continue his work on multi-collection. Also intends to come up with suggestions for the Checkstyle rules.
Twan: Will take on the tasks that were assigned to Tushit (The language switch epic)
Petar: Intends to finish his work on tags, and to start implementing note links.
