# Meeting Monday 16 Dec

next wed. Tushit online, share screen by demo
search during typing issue:
now: create new, send request, refresh
maybe better: 
- fetch all notes to client, do it client side (con: much stuff over network)
- add sidebar, wait for server simple response

### Improvements (from now on)
Add time tracking in Gitlab
make issues like user stories, and descriptive naming

### Issue board
1. To do for each epic individuality 
2. In progress, for the active issue for each person. Keep it there until merged to main

### To do basics
Title change/sync to server

collection might be more difficult in comparison with other extensions


### Tasks for next sprint (incl. Christmas break)
collections: Oleh
files: Pepijn
interconnected: Petr
languages: Tushit (almost done)
automated change sync: Liviu
keyboard shortcuts and accessibility: Twan

if done early: ask others to help with their tasks.
if not done: no big deal, big tasks, we have to the times, so shift it over to next sprint.
